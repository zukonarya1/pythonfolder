### **2. The Priority Power-Up: The Eisenhower Matrix**

Not all tasks are created equal. Use this simple framework to sort your tasks into four categories, ensuring you focus your energy where it counts.

* **Do First (Urgent & Important):** These are tasks that have an immediate deadline and a high impact. Tackle them right away.
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`
* **Schedule (Important, Not Urgent):** These tasks are crucial for your long-term goals. Set aside specific, uninterrupted time for them.
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`
* **Delegate (Urgent, Not Important):** These tasks need to be done soon, but someone else could handle them. Free up your time by asking for help.
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`
* **Eliminate (Not Urgent, Not Important):** These are distractions. They add no value and can be dropped entirely.
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`
    * `[Task]` - `[Notes/Due Date]`

### **3. Your Daily Flow: Plan for Success**

Break your day into focused blocks. Instead of just listing what you'll do, decide **when** you'll do it. This creates a realistic map for your day.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8:00 AM - 9:00 AM** | `[Morning Routine/Focused Work]` | `[e.g., Clear inbox]` |
| **9:00 AM - 10:30 AM** | `[High-Impact Task]` | `[e.g., Complete draft of the report]` |
| **10:30 AM - 10:45 AM** | `[Quick Stretch or Walk]` | `[e.g., Get up and get some water]` |
| **10:45 AM - 12:00 PM** | `[Task]` | `[e.g., Meet with the team]` |
| **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM** | `[Lunch]` | `[e.g., Step away from the desk]` |
| **1:00 PM - 2:30 PM** | `[Task]` | `[e.g., Client calls]` |
